        "description": "Driving on LPG instead of petrol or diesel, CO2 emissions lower about 10%. Also, LPG releases 55% less NOx (nitrogen oxide) than petrol and 96% less than diesel, as well as 8% less particulate matter than petrol and 11% less than diesel. The LPG System, original equipped or installed aftermarket, allows you to save a lot. How much does 1 litre of LPG cost? One of the biggest advantages is fuel cost, for sure; it costs 60% less than petrol. A road tax reduction is granted in case of purchase of a bi-fuel car or conversion of a petrol car, according to your residence. LPG systems are more and more safe and efficient, so that vehicle performances basically don’t change after converting it. In many cities, an LPG car can move freely in traffic restriction areas too.",

The effect — improved fuel efficiency. Hybrids have better fuel efficiency and conserve more energy, thus emitting fewer carbon emissions. Since hybrid vehicles are able to utilize the high voltage battery pack and electric motor(s) for propulsion, they don't rely on fossil fuels as much as standard gas cars. When you apply the brakes while driving most hybrid vehicles, energy is produced and used to recharge your high voltage battery. This action can result in less fuel consumption.",
